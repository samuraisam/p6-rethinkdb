RethinkDB Perl 6
============

A Perl 6 driver for RethinkDB

## Usage

Seriously, don't use this yet.

## Prerequisites

RethinkDB requires nothing more than core Perl 6 (and RethinkDB of course), 
and is tested with current Rakudo on at least the JVM, Parrot and 
Moar backends.


## Installation

To manage expectations, we have *not* added RethinkDB to the Perl 6
module ecosystem yet; thus you cannot simply `panda install RethinkDB`
in a single step.  However you can use Panda to install from a git clone,
as follows:

    $ git clone https://github.com/samuraisam/p6-rethinkdb.git
    $ panda install p6-pb


## Getting Help

For help with RethinkDB, please come to the `#perl6` IRC channel on
`irc.freenode.net` and ask for `ssutch`.  If I'm not available
right away, stick around and I'll get back to you in a bit.


## Reporting Bugs

Bugs and feature requests can be filed in the project's
[GitHub issues queue](https://github.com/samuraisam/p6-rethinkdb/issues).


## Contributing

Thank you for contributing!  Please send GitHub pull requests, and we'll
take a look as soon as we can.  Regular contributors are welcome to request
commit bits from us on `#perl6` (see Getting Help above).
